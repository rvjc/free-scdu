SCDU (pronounced "skidoo") is a versatile command-line toolkit for
analysing, generating and manipulating data.

SCDU is freely distributed as a series of stand-alone executables
supporting a wide range of operating systems and CPU architectures.
No installers are required; just copy the appropriate executable to a
binary directory on the host or run directly from an external device
such as a USB stick.
   
SCDU is designed from the ground up to pack as much functionality as
possible into a compact binary with no external dependencies beyond a
basic OS stack. This means that it is equally at home in embedded
devices, boot disks, virtual machines and high-end server clusters.

SCDU is a veritable "Swiss Army Knife" for programmers, sysadmins and
data forensics experts in the varied landscape of the Internet Age.
It's terse, platform-agnostic and script-friendly interface maximises
productivity without compromising performance and reliability. These
attributes also make SCDU the engine-of-choice for higher level data
utilities and automation solutions

SCDU is also a useful educational tool for exploring file formats and
data protocols.

SCDU is an acronym for "Super Consolidated Data Utility" while owing
its speedy character to the timeless expression "23 Skidoo".
