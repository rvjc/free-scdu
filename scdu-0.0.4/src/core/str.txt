## Str Module

str.h str.cpp

Note: this is a core module (see core documentation).

### Str Class

This is a simple string class which uses a fixed internal buffer for small
strings and the heap for larger strings. Unlike the standard string class,
it uses malloc/realloc/free instead of new/delete therby avoiding exceptions
and introducing new efficiencies through the use of realloc().

Traditional C strings are still preferred, especially for local variables.
The Str class is handy in the following scenarios:

    * The string size is unknown and/or potentially very large
    * The string is global (or part of a global data structure/class)

### Z Functions

Functions with a "z" suffix are variants of standard library string functions
which will always null terminate the target string even when the size limit is
reached. It is assumed that the target buffer can hold at least one character
more than the size argument.
