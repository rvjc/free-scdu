## Parse Module

parse.h parse.cpp

Note: this is a core module (see core documentation).

### Basic Parse Functions

The standard library functions, strtol() and family, have the following
limitations:

    * They do not automatically detect hex values and other symbols
    * They are too forgiving, converting any old garbage to zero
    * They only detect range errors (for the given type)

The basic parse functions provided by this module require string pointer and
value reference arguments. They return the following integer values:  

    0:  String successfully converted to value
    -1: String is badly formatted, value remains unchanged
    +1: String is out of range, value remains unchanged

### Advanced Parse Functions

These functions use a Var& reference to implement more advanced parsing. As
such, they return Pen type which gives more extensive error indication.
