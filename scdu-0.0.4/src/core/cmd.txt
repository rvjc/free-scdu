## Cmd Module

cmd.h cmd.cpp

Note: this is a core module (see core documentation).

The Cmd class holds user settings and environment variables for the current
execution cycle.

User settings consist of the current action, options and parameters. All of
these have consisent defaults which may be over-ridden via the command-line.
Options can also be specified in a configuration file using the -cf option.

The init() method parses the command-line and config file (if specified) to
establish all environment variables and user settings for the current cycle. 

The global cmd object is a special instance of the Cmd class exposed to the
remaining the code base. Since this object is accessed extensively, it is
declared as a const for added safety. To satisfy const correctness rules when
calling the init() method, certain data members are declared as mutable.
However, once the init() method gas been called successfully, all settings are
effectively locked.

### Options

Options can be specified using short symbols prefixed with a single minus (-)
or longer names prefixed with a double minus (--). Short options are more suited
to the command-line where space is at a premium while the more descriptive long
option is more suited to a config file.

### Multi-Options

Single character short-option symbols are reserved for the most ubiquitous flag
options which may also be combined in compact groups by prefixing with a plus(+)
e.g. +rfa 

### Config File

All options (apart from -cf) may be specified in a config file. Global options
at the top of the file represent the default for all actions which may be
over-ridden in action-specific sections preceded by @<action> declarations.
Comments lines may be included in the standard way using a leading # character.
Leading and trailing whitespace on each line is ignored, so indents may be
used to assist readability. 

For increased versatility, the same option may be specified more than once on
the command-line or config file. When this happens, the following sequence is
respected when values are over-ridden:

    1. options specified on the command-line BEFORE the -cf option
    2. options specified in the global section of the config file
    3. options specified in the action-specific section of the config file
    4. options specified on the command-line AFTER the -cf option

Sample config file:

`
    # scdu.cfg
    # config file by Shane Callanan

    # global options

    --progress-rate=0.5

    # action-specific options

    @copy

    --route-std=CA
    --route-dgn=P
    --progress-rate=0.5

    @help

    --route-std=R
`
