Application-optimised file classes

### FileBuffer 

A FileBuffer is an abstract class with the following concrete implementations
for reading and writing files:

    * FileReader
    * FileWriter

A FileBuffer is analogous to a standard file stream. However, it's design is
optimised for intensive operations on very large files e.g. compression and
decompression. A custom class also allows scope for future enhancements,
especially for overcoming platform and file system related quirks. While
standard file streams offer a certain amount of buffer control, this is not
always sufficient for our purposes.
